## Documentation

### How to download?

Click [here] (https://github.com/maelsoucaze/flarum/archive/master.zip) or on the *Download ZIP* button located in the right sidebar. As simple as that!

### How to install?

Once the compressed extension downloaded, you will need to extract the archive with a [file archiver] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_archivers).

Using [FTP] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), you will need to browse into your Flarum root (which contains the *config.php* file). You will see an *extensions/* directory. Inside this directory, you have to create a *french/* directory. Then, upload the content of the previous extracted archive inside the *french/* directory.

Now that the extension is uploaded to your server, you will need to enable it. Log-in to your forum and click on your username located at the top right of the screen. You will see a pop-up, and you will have to click on the *Administration* link. Once in the administration page, you will have to click on *Extensions*. You will see all your extensions. Note the French extension is the one grey tinted, with a white icon of the Earth and a blue background. Hover the extension and you will see a dotted vertical menu. Click on the vertical menu and click on *Enable*.

Your French extension is now enabled. Congratulations! You, and your users, can now select the language via a dropdown menu located in the header, at the right of the search box.

### How to update?

Once the updated compressed extension downloaded, you will need to extract the archive with a [file archiver] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_archivers).

Using [FTP] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), you will need to browse into your Flarum root (which contains the *config.php* file). You have to access to your *extensions/french/* directory. Inside this directory, upload the new files by replacing the old ones.

Your French extension files are now updated, but you have to clear the cache of your forum to apply the changes. Again, using [FTP] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), you will need to browse into your Flarum root (which contains the *config.php* file) and to locate the *assets/* directory. Inside the directory, you will see *forum-fr-XYZ.js* and *admin-fr-XYZ.js* files, with *XYZ* as random letters and numbers. Please delete these files. Enjoy now the latest improvements and fixes of the updated extension!
