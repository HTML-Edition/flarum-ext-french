## Documentation

### Installation

Follow [these simple step-by-step instructions](http://flarum.org/docs/languages/) from the Flarum website.

Note that all the unpacked content of the downloaded French language pack archive must be uploaded into a **maelsoucaze-french/** subdirectory (without the slash punctuation mark at the end) that you have to create in the **extensions/** directory.

### Terminology

I enforce to use proper French terms chosen by official institutions which are [Académie française](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise), [Délégation générale à la langue française et aux langues de France](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9l%C3%A9gation_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_%C3%A0_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise_et_aux_langues_de_France), [Commission générale de terminologie et de néologie](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_de_terminologie_et_de_n%C3%A9ologie) and [Office québécois de la langue française](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise).

However, because some official terms are inadequate or unpopular, I may use different terms than the official ones to stay as understandable as possible for everyone. You can see in [this documentation](https://gist.github.com/maelsoucaze/eef79ce417eff38d1d57) (written in French) the list of some terms used in the localization. Feel free to discuss with me on the best terms to use!
